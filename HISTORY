manually revised 2006: 
- added missing text
- changed "textualized" forms to what's actually spoken
- fixed a few extraction mistakes (e.g. page numbers in long documents?)
- put each sentence on its own line (for what it's worth)
- DID NOT change often awkward sentence segmentation (Merkel's sentences aren't always easy to parse or write down...)
